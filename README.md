# Deformable Radial Kernel Splatting

DRK representation extends Gaussian kernels with learnable radial bases, enabling the modeling of diverse shape primitives. Additionally, parameters are introduced to control the sharpness and boundary curvature of these primitives. The following video showcase the effectiveness of each parameter.
